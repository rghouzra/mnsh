# Minishell (mnsh)

Minishell is a simple Bash executor and reader.

## Overview

Minishell is a lightweight shell implementation inspired by Bash, designed to execute and interpret shell commands.

### Process Flow

This flowchart provides an overview of both tokenization and parsing steps:

## Implementation

To achieve Minishell's functionality, we follow these key steps:

1. Tokenization: In general, we use Bash as a reference, particularly for splitting commands into tokens, handling whitespaces, and operators.
   - [Bash Manual - Basic Shell Features](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Basic-Shell-Features)

2. Parsing: We generate an abstract syntax tree (AST) using the Shunting Yard algorithm, which involves implementing our stack and queue data structures.
   - [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://brilliant.org/wiki/shunting-yard-algorithm/)
   - In the srcs/utils/readinput.c, there's a function that prints in the dot language format, producing a file named "treegraph.dot". You can visualize this tree using Graphviz or by installing the Graphviz extension if you're using VS Code.
3. Execution: The final step is traversing the AST recursively and evaluating whether each node represents an operator or a command.
